# PDEFourierAnalysis.jl

This is a package for calculating and plotting the stability regions of
numerical methods via Fourier analysis. The aim is to provide a many of the
standard quantities of interest in the numerical analysis for spatial,
temporal and coupled methods.

# Organisation
Methods are broken down into three groups, these are:
 - Temporal, which are ODE methods
 - Spatial, which are methods that approximate spatial derivatives of a given PDE
 - Scheme, which are the combination of a spatial and temporal method
